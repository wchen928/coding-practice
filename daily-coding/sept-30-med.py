"""
This problem was asked by Jane Street.

cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and last element of that pair. For example, car(cons(3, 4)) returns 3, and cdr(cons(3, 4)) returns 4.

Given this implementation of cons: Implement car and cdr. 
"""

def cons(a, b):
    def pair(f):
        return f(a, b)
    return pair

def car(f):
    def left(a, b):
        return a
    return f(left)

#f(left) calls left(a, b), a is returned, and car() can return that to the caller

def cdr(f):
    def right(a, b):
        return b
    return f(right)

print(car(cons(3,4)))
print(cdr(cons(3,4)))
